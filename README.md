## Lessons Learned

During the course of this project, being relatively new to Vue, I encountered challenges in understanding some of its core concepts. Among them, the usage of ref from Vue's Composition API stood out. Essentially, ref is used to create reactive references to values. Whenever the value of this reference changes, Vue automatically updates the component to reflect these changes. At first, managing these reactive references seemed intricate. However, after diving deeper into Vue's documentation and related online resources, I began to grasp its importance in maintaining state and ensuring reactivity within components. This project was not only about overcoming specific technical challenges; it was also a holistic learning experience that expanded my understanding of modern frontend development, best practices, and the importance of persistence. I am genuinely grateful for this given opportunity. While I acknowledge that my code might not look perfect, I am sincerely committed to continuous learning and growth. I believe that every challenge faced is a stepping stone, and with dedication, I will strive to become a proficient developer in the near future.

   Thank You,
